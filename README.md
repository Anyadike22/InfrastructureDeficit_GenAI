# Project Title: Infrastructure Deficit in Africa

## Introduction
In this project, we delve into the infrastructure deficit in Africa, shedding light on critical challenges and potential solutions. The lack of adequate infrastructure—such as roads, electricity, water supply, and communication networks—poses significant obstacles to economic development, social well-being, and overall progress across the continent.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Dataset
### Dataset Description
- *Source*: [Insert dataset source or link here]
- *Description*: Provide a concise overview of the dataset, including its origin, format, and relevant features related to infrastructure.
- *Objective*: Explain the purpose of conducting EDA on this dataset and how it informs our understanding of Africa's infrastructure deficit.

### EDA Tasks
1. *Data Cleaning and Preprocessing*:
   - Address missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.
   - Standardize data formats (e.g., date formats, categorical variables).
2. *Descriptive Statistics*:
   - Compute summary statistics (mean, median, etc.) for relevant infrastructure-related variables.
   - Visualize distributions (histograms, box plots, etc.).
3. *Exploratory Visualizations*:
   - Create informative plots (bar charts, scatter plots, etc.) to explore relationships between infrastructure indicators.
   - Identify patterns, trends, and potential correlations.
4. *Geospatial Analysis*:
   - Map infrastructure distribution across African countries.
   - Highlight regions with the most acute deficits.

## Chatbot Development
### Objective
Our goal is to build an interactive chatbot that allows users to query information related to infrastructure in Africa. We'll leverage the power of Llama3 and Groq LPU (Language Processing Units) for natural language understanding and efficient data retrieval.

### Chatbot Features
1. *User Queries*:
   - Users can ask questions about specific infrastructure types (e.g., roads, electricity availability, water supply coverage).
   - The chatbot responds with relevant data or insights.
2. *Natural Language Understanding (NLU)*:
   - Implement advanced NLU techniques using Llama3 to understand user intent accurately.
   - Utilize Groq LPU for efficient query processing.
3. *Data Retrieval*:
   - Connect the chatbot to relevant datasets or APIs containing infrastructure-related information.
   - Retrieve data based on user queries.
4. *User-Friendly Interface*:
   - Develop an intuitive interface (possibly using Streamlit) for users to interact with the chatbot seamlessly.

## Getting Started
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install any necessary dependencies (if specified in your chatbot script).
3. Run the chatbot (chatbot.py or similar) to start querying Africa's infrastructure data.

## Contributing
Contributions are welcome! If you have ideas for improving the chatbot's functionality or want to add more features, feel free to submit a pull request.
